# Flipkart Reviews Sentiment Analysis

A sentiment analysis project focused on identifying and classifying customer feedback from Flipkart reviews using machine learning. Designed with a strong emphasis on validation, testing, and result interpretability — aligning with a software quality assurance perspective.

##   Focus Areas for Software QA
- Ensured **data integrity** through thorough exploratory data analysis.
- Conducted **validation and testing** of machine learning models using clear metrics and visualization tools.
- Assessed **model reliability and generalization** via confusion matrix and test accuracy.
- Used **visual diagnostics** (e.g., word clouds, heatmaps) to explain and verify classification behavior.

##   Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NLTK
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

##   Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Validated dataset consistency, checked nulls, and reviewed distribution of sentiment classes.

2. **Text Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Applied NLP preprocessing including stopword removal and tokenization.

3. **Feature Engineering & Modeling**
   - Vectorized text using TF-IDF.
   - Built and tested models with focus on reproducibility and interpretability.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated accuracy and confusion matrix.
   - Used visual tools to analyze false positives/negatives — critical for QA-focused error analysis.

##  QA-Centric Insights
- Prioritized **model transparency and debuggability**.
- Highlighted potential data/model biases through visual exploration.
- Designed with traceable steps to allow **repeatable testing** of NLP pipeline performance.
